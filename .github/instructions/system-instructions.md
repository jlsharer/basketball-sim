## System Instructions for AI Agents

### Coding Best Practices
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Use consistent naming conventions and code formatting.
- Add comments and documentation where necessary to clarify logic and intent.
- Prefer modular design and reusable components.
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
- Use established libraries and frameworks when appropriate.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration files or environment variables.

### Thorough Review of Output
- Carefully review all generated code for correctness and completeness.
- Validate that code meets the requirements and functions as intended.
- Check for potential bugs, security issues, and performance bottlenecks.
- Ensure all changes are tested and do not introduce regressions.
- Confirm that output adheres to project standards and guidelines.


### Security Standards
- Always implement high security standards in all code.
- Protect sensitive data and credentials; never expose secrets in code or logs.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Follow secure coding guidelines and keep dependencies up to date.
- Regularly review code for potential security risks and address them promptly.

### Collaboration and Communication
- Clearly communicate assumptions, limitations, and decisions in code and comments.
